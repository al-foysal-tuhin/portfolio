[Publication](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Ks1UHHiIWUaQAcVQ5f9t2-1osE3hyz1p/view?usp=sharing)

Worked with my supervisor, on a paper for my undergraduate thesis that proposes a heuristic model for sentiment analysis on luxury hotel reviews to analyze and explore marketing insights from attitudes and emotions expressed in reviews. [Accepted for publication in the International Conference on Data Science & Exploration in Artificial Intelligence, 2024 (MAHE) & procedure to publish ongoing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1l5P8lZl1aPehc8b_ghNYRdA2pZbdDiIF/view?usp=sharing)

- Collected approximately 5000 data from Google reviews & Trip-Advisor reviews of 70 hotels in 14 European countries & Implemented 6 different classification algorithms and plotted the comparison between them.
- Visualized performance comparison between different countries and hotels distinctively.
- Reduced bias of previous research paper submitted to Google Scholar.
